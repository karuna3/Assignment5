## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(rvest)
library(tidyr)
library(lubridate)

url<-'https://www.reckontalk.com/cricket-players-date-of-birth/'

table<-as.data.frame(read_html(url) %>% html_nodes(xpath = '//*[@id="wpo-content"]/div/div[2]/div[1]/table') %>% html_table())

table$AgeInYears<-round(interval(as.Date(table$Date.Of.Birth,format("%d-%B-%Y")), today()) / years(1),1)
colnames(table)[1]<-"Sr No"

print(table)
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
